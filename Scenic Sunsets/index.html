          “The Taj Mahal in the Indian state of Agra is regarded as one of the
          world’s architectural wonders. It transforms into one of the best
          sunsets in the world when the day comes to an end and the sun starts
          to set behind it. The sun’s rays bend and wind round the white marble
          dome, bathing the stuccoed walls, minarets and garden in a soft pink
          and orange haze.”

          “Zanzibar is a beautiful island off the coast of Tanzania. It has
          multiple tropical beaches that are the perfect spots to watch the hot
          African sun disappear. Alternatively, hop on a boat and cruise about
          on the gentle waves, stained blood-red by the setting sun. It might
          just be the best sunset in the world!”

          “Sunset on safari is a must-see sight. The Maasai Mara National
          Reserve in Kenya is one of the most magical places to enjoy it. The
          sun’s rays begin to cool as it sinks beneath the horizon, immersing
          the land and wildlife in a rusty orange light. Remember your camera,
          because this is surely one of the most beautiful sunsets in the
          world.”

          “Quiraing is an oddly shaped landslip on the Isle of Skye’s
          Trotternish Ridge. But for all its uniqueness, it offers a beautiful
          mountain sunset. It's a favourite spot among photographers, who come
          armed with their lenses. As the sun sets, the light bounces off the
          crags and crevices, and this light show becomes even more
          captivating.”

          “If it’s possible, Arizona’s Grand Canyon becomes even more incredible
          at sunset. The rocks, towers, cliffs and crevices turn a deep shade of
          red, tinged with burnt orange. It’s like the whole canyon is on fire.”

          "The strange thing about the sunset is that we actually don’t want the
          sun to set, we want it to stay right on the horizon, not below it, not
          above it, just right on it." – Mehmet Murat Ildan
