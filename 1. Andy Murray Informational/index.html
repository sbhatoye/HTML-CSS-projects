          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            Sir Andrew Barron Murray (born 15 May 1987) is a British
            professional tennis player. He was ranked world No. 1 by the
            Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 41 weeks, and finished
            as the year-end No. 1 in 2016. Murray has won three Grand Slam
            singles titles, two at Wimbledon (2013 and 2016) and one at the US
            Open (2012), and has reached eleven major finals. Murray was ranked
            in the top 10 for all but one month from July 2008 through October
            2017, and was no lower than world No. 4 in eight of the nine
            year-end rankings during that span. Murray has won 46 ATP singles
            titles, including 14 Masters 1000 events.

            <br />
            Since 2016, he has struggled with various injuries and fell out of
            the top 100 in 2018 due to only seldom playing on tour, though he
            has since slowly risen back to the top 50.
            <br />
            <br />
            Murray is an all-court player who excels in particular at defense,
            returning serve and constructing points. He is generally regarded as
            having one of the best and most consistent two-handed backhands on
            the ATP Tour. Murray is considered a national hero in Great Britain
            for reestablishing the country as a leading force in men's tennis
            for the first time since the early 20th century. (<em
