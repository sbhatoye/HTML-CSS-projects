# HTML & CSS PROJECTS

## 1) Andy Murray Informational

### About 

This is a one-page informational about tennis player Andy Murray.

### Inspiration

I watched Andy Murray's documentary on Prime called Resurfacing and I was curious to learn more about him. As I was researching, I got inspired to make my first HTML/CSS project on him and pay tribute to his impressive journey as an athlete.

A web form for a pet grooming shop that collects various types of  inputs from the user.
